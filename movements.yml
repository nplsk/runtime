# movements.yml
# This configuration file defines the parameters for each movement phase in the video playback system.
# Each movement has specific characteristics that control how clips are selected and played.

# Orientation Phase
# Initial phase that sets up the experience with a single layer of clips
# Uses quick bursts of clips followed by longer sustained clips
orientation:

  duration_range: [8, 20]            # Min/max duration for each clip in seconds
  allow_loop: False                  # Whether clips can loop
